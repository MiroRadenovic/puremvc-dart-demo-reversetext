--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0.3 - Updated pubspec.yaml to pull in dart.js from pub.dartlang.org
        Changed ReverseText.html to point to packages/browser/dart.js

2.0.2 - Updated pubspec.yaml to pull in PureMVC from pub.dartlang.org

2.0.1 - Minor update to fix the import/source/part/'part of' syntax. Also 
        it was necessary to add a library declaration get the app to compile,
        otherwise the following compile-time error appears on every class:
        "Unit is part of library 'null', but has no 'part of' directive"

2.0.0 - Added pubspec, renamed app, changed license, refactored to use
        PureMVC 2.0.0 (framework class names changed, use package prefix).
      
1.5.0 - Changed static finals to static consts following a breaking change
        to the Dart language leading up to the M1 release.
      
1.4.0 - Fixed constants in TextProxy (made static final), removing the
	    error reported in TextComponentMediator's handleNotification switch.

1.3.0 - Fixed the ProcessTextCommand where the use of removeLast()
        is apparently no longer supported by Dart.
      
1.2.0 - Updated to match the moving target of Dart:
	    Importing PureMVC from the web rather than expecting it to be in the
	    workspace. Refactored to work with dart:html instead of dart:dom.
	    Fixed CSS height of input boxes.
	  
1.1.0 - Included .project and .children so that Dart Editor can
	    run the framework verification page (PureMVC_Dart.dart).
	    The need for these files should be eliminated in a future
	    version of the editor, but they are required now.

1.0 - First official release on PureMVC.org.
