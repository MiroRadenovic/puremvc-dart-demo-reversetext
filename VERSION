--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.0 - Added pubspec, renamed app, changed license, refactored to use
      PureMVC 2.0.0 (framework class names changed, use package prefix).
      
1.5 - Changed static finals to static consts following a breaking change
      to the Dart language leading up to the M1 release.
      
1.4 - Fixed constants in TextProxy (made static final), removing the
	  error reported in TextComponentMediator's handleNotification switch.

1.3 - Fixed the ProcessTextCommand where the use of removeLast()
      is apparently no longer supported by Dart.
      
1.2 - Updated to match the moving target of Dart:
	  Importing PureMVC from the web rather than expecting it to be in the
	  workspace. Refactored to work with dart:html instead of dart:dom.
	  Fixed CSS height of input boxes.
	  
1.1 - Included .project and .children so that Dart Editor can
	  run the framework verification page (PureMVC_Dart.dart).
	  The need for these files should be eliminated in a future
	  version of the editor, but they are required now.

1.0 - First official release on PureMVC.org.
